    "When it comes to analyzing data, the essential thing is to have good libraries at hand. In our tutorial, we'll use two of the basic yet most important and popular libraries: [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (for data manipulation) and [plot.ly](https://plot.ly/python/) (for making interactive publication-quality visualizations).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While pandas is almost the standard de facto for data manipulation, there are more than one popular visualization libraries (e.g. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/) to name a few). For the sake of simplicity, in this tutorial, we use `plotly.express` which is a less-verbose wrapper around `plotly`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, since we are going to publish our data and visualizations on [dstack.ai](https://dstack.ai), we'll use [dstack Python library](https://pypi.org/project/dstack/)."

    "Now imagine that you'd like to publish the resulting data online and share it with other people.\n",

    "You can do that by using the `dstack` library. The library provides an API to publish both `pandas` data frames and `plotly` visualizations (it also supports other visualization libraries).\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice thing about `dstack` is that it lets you publish data and visualizations, and keeps them interactive: e.g. the user may change parameters and see the corresponding data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is published, it can be accessed via a link. Other people can access it and comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to publish `pandas` dataframes or `plotly`'s figures, you have to create a dstack frame and specify the name of the stack. Stack can be later access via a URL, e.g. `https://dstack.ai/<user>/<stack>`. Every stack may have many frames. Frames are revisions of published data. Each stack points to its head frame – the latest version of the published data. A frame includes a list of attachments. Every attachment can be a visualization or a dataframe and may have own parameters associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Publishing top 50 countries by increase in new cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us use a simple example to better understand the concept of stacks, frames and attachments.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We create a frame and give it a stack name `covid19/speed`. This means that this frame will be published to a stack that can be accessed via `https://dstack.ai/<user>/covid19/speed`.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note that the current user is configured via the `dstack` command line utility and is stored along with your dstack.ai secure token in a local user directory. You can learn how it can be installed at [docs.dstack.ai](https://docs.dstack.ai)._\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For both cases, i.e., increase in absolute numbers and increase in %, we'll publish a separate dataframe so the user accessing the published data can switch between two tables. Each dataframe is committed as a separate attachment along with a description and corresponding parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We push the frame to send all attachments"
